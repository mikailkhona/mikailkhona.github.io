"Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive:
attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain.
In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable."
  In my life, I have given a fuck about many things. I have also not given a fuck about many things. And like the road not taken,
it was the fucks not given that made all the difference. These moments of non-fuckery are the moments that most define our lives.
  To not give a fuck is to stare down life’s most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action.
There is a subtle art to not giving a fuck. And though the concept may sound ridiculous and I may sound like an
asshole, what I’m talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively— 
how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values. 
  This is incredibly difficult. It takes a lifetime of practice and discipline to achieve. And you will regularly fail. 
But it is perhaps the most worthy struggle one can undertake in one’s life. It is perhaps the only struggle in one’s life.
Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re
perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way 
you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, 
every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal.
You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster,
running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere.
- The subtle art of not giving a fuck, Mark Manson
