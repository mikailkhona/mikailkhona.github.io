## Neurodiversity

Here I have a collection of webpages, articles and resources for people to better understand what it means to be neurodivergent. Also listed are various communities working to serve the neurodivergent community. 

If you have heard of any such community in to academia (especially neuroscience) or are interested in creating one (especially at MIT/ the Boston area), reach out!
