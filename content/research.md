## Research interests
When an organism is born, its brain is already capable of complex computations despite not having any experience.
I am interested in how biology builds powerful structured priors in neural circuits in the brain and how we can best understand the mechanisms that underlie them. Often, these priors take the shape of simple bottom-up processes & rules and ideas inspired from physics come of use.

I am also interested in how similar structures can be incorporated into artificial neural networks. I believe this will speed up learning and improve generalization, bringing ANNs closer to human-like intelligence.

Modular structures in the brain play a central role in compositionality and intelligence, however the general mechanisms driving module emergence have remained elusive. Studying entorhinal grid cells as paradigmatic examples of modular architecture and function, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of a small number of discrete spatial and functional modules from an interplay between continuously varying lateral interactions generated by smooth cortical gradients. We derive a comprehensive analytic theory of modularization, revealing that the process is highly generic with its robustness deriving from topological origins. The theory generates universal predictions for the sequence of grid period ratios, furnishing the most accurate explanation of grid cell data to date. Altogether, this work reveals novel principles by which simple bottom-up dynamical interactions lead to macroscopic modular organization.
