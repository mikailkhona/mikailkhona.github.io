Modular structures in the brain play a central role in compositionality and intelligence, however the general mechanisms driving module emergence have remained elusive. Studying entorhinal grid cells as paradigmatic examples of modular architecture and function, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of a small number of discrete spatial and functional modules from an interplay between continuously varying lateral interactions generated by smooth cortical gradients. We derive a comprehensive analytic theory of modularization, revealing that the process is highly generic with its robustness deriving from topological origins. The theory generates universal predictions for the sequence of grid period ratios, furnishing the most accurate explanation of grid cell data to date. Altogether, this work reveals novel principles by which simple bottom-up dynamical interactions lead to macroscopic modular organization.
