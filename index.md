Hi, welcome to my webpage!

I do research in computational and theoretical systems neuroscience. I am primarily advised by Ila Fiete (fietelab.mit.edu)
You can have a look at my research and publications using the links on the right.

## Research interests
I am interested in how biology builds powerful structured priors in neural circuits in the brain and how we can best understand the processes that lead to them. I am also interested in how similar structures can be incorporated into artificial neural networks. I believe this will speed up learning and improve generalization, bringing ANNs closer to human-like intelligence.
