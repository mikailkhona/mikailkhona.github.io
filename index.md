# About Me
Physics PhD candidate, MIT

Hi I am Mikail and welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD candidate in the department of <a href = 'https://physics.mit.edu'> Physics </a> at MIT. I am primarily advised by <a href = '(fietelab.mit.edu)'> Ila Fiete </a>.

I started off wanting to reverse-engineer the Universe (aka do physics research), then decided to try reverse-engineering the brain (aka computational and theoretical neuroscience) and am now trying to reverse-engineer deep neural networks.

I received my undergraduate degree in engineering physics with a minor in pure mathematics from the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay'> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>.


You can read more about my research <a href ='https://mikailkhona.github.io/content/research.html'>here</a>. My Google scholar page <a href ='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5f0SYQAAAAJ&hl=en'> here </a> is the most up-to-date.
