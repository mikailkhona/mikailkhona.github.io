Hi, welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD candidate in the department of <a href = 'https://physics.mit.edu'> Physics </a> at MIT. I am primarily advised by <a href = '(fietelab.mit.edu)'> Ila Fiete </a> and do research in computational and theoretical systems neuroscience, working at the intersection of neurobiology and artificial intelligence. I received my undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics from the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay'> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>.

Outside of science, I am part of <a href = 'http://gymnastics.mit.edu/index.html'> MIT's artistic gymnastics club team </a> and enjoy playing the latest game Pokemon games.

You can have a look at my research and publications using the links on the left.
