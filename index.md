# Mikail Khona
Physics PhD student, MIT

I do research in computational and theoretical systems neuroscience. I am primarily advised by Ila Fiete (fietelab.mit.edu)

## Research interests
I am interested in how biology builds powerful structured priors in neural circuits in the brain and how we can best understand the processes that lead to them. I am also interested in how similar structures can be incorporated into artificial neural networks. I believe this will speed up learning and improve generalization, bringing ANNs closer to human-like intelligence.
