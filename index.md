# About Me
Physics PhD candidate, MIT

Hi I am Mikail and welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD candidate in the department of <a href = 'https://physics.mit.edu'> Physics </a> at MIT. I am primarily advised by <a href = '(fietelab.mit.edu)'> Ila Fiete </a>.

I started off wanting to reverse-engineer the Universe (aka do physics research), then decided to try reverse-engineering the brain (aka computational and theoretical neuroscience) and am now trying to reverse-engineer deep neural networks.

I received my undergraduate degree in engineering physics with a minor in pure mathematics from the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay'> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>.

My Google scholar page <a href ='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5f0SYQAAAAJ&hl=en'> here </a> is the most up-to-date.

What is physics? To me—growing up with a father and mother both of whom were physicists—physics was not subject matter. The atom, the troposphere, the nucleus, a piece of glass, the washing machine, my bicycle, the phonograph, a magnet—these were all incidentally the subject matter. The central idea was that the world is understandable, that you should be able to take anything apart, understand the relationships between its constituents, do experiments, and on that basis be able to develop a quantitative understanding of its behavior. Physics was a point of view that the world around us is, with effort, ingenuity, and adequate resources, understandable in a predictive and reasonably quantitative fashion. Being a physicist is a dedication to a quest for this kind of understanding. - John J. Hopfield


On kindness:

The best way to spot an idiot is to look for the person who is cruel.
When we see someone who doesn't look like us, sound like us, live like us, the first thought that crosses anyone's brain is rooted in fear or judgment or both. That’s evolution —- we survived by being suspicious of anything we weren’t familiar with. In order to be kind, we have to shut down that animal instinct and force our brain to travel a different pathway. Empathy and compassion are evolved states of being; they require mental capacity to step back from our most primal urges. In recent times, our society has come to believe that weaponized cruelty is some kind of well-thought-out master plan. Cruelty is seen by some as a cudgel to gain power. Empathy and kindness are considered weak. Acts of cruelty signify a failure to pass the first test of an advanced society.
